# Small-Adventure
A little game of my own, created in 48h for my application in Artefacts Studio

In order to install the game on your computer, you'll need to launch "LittleAdventure\_Setup.exe"
It will install the game, the assets, and the sources on your computer.

You can also take a look at the sources in the repository.

BE CAREFULL ! The game has a Saving Option, in order to save your progression in case of crash, or if you want to stop playing for a while.
BUT this option can't work if you don't execute the game with Administrations rights. You have been Warned.

Please Enjoy your time with Little Adventure !

Etienne DOYON.
